# Midnight Monsoon

Midnight Monsoon is an interactive, retro-style pixel story that immerses players in a stormy, atmospheric adventure. Set within the cozy confines of a coffee shop as rain pounds against the windows, the story evolves based on player choices, leading them down various paths. Through a series of prompts, players decide what actions to takeâ€”such as finding refuge in a nearby hotel or risking the journey through a subway entrance. The story ultimately presents a pivotal choice that determines the player's fate. Players can also opt to stop the story at any time, and each ending scene provides a unique resolution based on their decisions.
